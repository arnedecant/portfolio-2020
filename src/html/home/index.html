                I was product owner and lead developer of the <a href="https://showreal.immo/" target="_blank">Showreal</a>-team 
                at <a href="https://www.nanopixel3d.com/" target="_blank">Nanopixel</a>. Showreal is an innovative, award winning

            <p>
                During my spare time, I like to progress my skills in domains which aren't accessable during work hours. This way, I
                have developed some skills in realtime development using the WebGL library <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank">three.js</a>.

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
                My name is Arne Decant and I was born and raised in Kortrijk, Belgium. I went to school to study a joined 
                education accounting/informatics, whereafter I chose to go to college and continue in informatics. I studied 
                <a href="https://www.mct.be" target="_blank">MCT</a> (Multimedia and Communication Technology) at 
                <a href="https://www.howest.be" target="_blank">Howest</a>, University College of West Flanders, and finished 
                my education in June 2014.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wrote my first line of code in 2009, when I was 15, but only learned how to do so properly 2 years after, 
                during my first year in college. In 2014 I started my first job as a frontend webdeveloper and worked on several websites
                and applications for the local police departments and clients in the event sector. In 2018 I started at 
                <a href="https://www.nanopixel3d.com" target="_blank">Nanopixel</a>, an award-winning 3D visualisations company located in Roeselare.
                There, I was product owner and lead developer of <a href="https://showreal.immo/" target="_blank">Showreal</a>, working for
                clients like Versluys, Degroote, ION, Vestio and many more from the real estate market.
