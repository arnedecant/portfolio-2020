                During my spare time, I like to progress my skills in domains which aren't accessable during work hours. This way, I

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p data-background="multiline">
                My name is Arne Decant and I was born and raised in Kortrijk, Belgium. I went to school to study a joined 
                education accounting/informatics, whereafter I chose to go to college and continue in informatics. I studied 
                <a href="https://www.mct.be" target="_blank">MCT</a> (Multimedia and Communication Technology) at 
                <a href="https://www.howest.be" target="_blank">Howest</a>, University College of West Flanders, and finished 
                my education in June 2014.
            </p>
            <p data-background="multiline">
                I wrote my first line of code in 2009, when I was 15, but only learned how to do so properly 2 years after, 
                during my first year in college. In 2014 I started my first job as a frontend webdeveloper and worked on several websites
                and applications for the local police departments and clients in the event sector. In 2018 I started at 
                <a href="https://www.nanopixel3d.com" target="_blank">Nanopixel</a>, an award-winning 3D visualisations company located in Roeselare.
                There, I was product owner and lead developer of <a href="https://showreal.immo/" target="_blank">Showreal</a>, working for
                clients like Versluys, Degroote, ION, Vestio and many more from the real estate market.

        <h2>Playground</h2>
        <p>
            View a collection of works or experiments I made during my spare time. Some projects might not be finished though. 
            The one I enjoyed the most is this <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/webcam-audio-visualizer/" target="_blank">Webcam Audio Visualizer</a>.
            Some game demos that I made include <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/rpg-game/" target="_blank">an RPG game</a>, 
            <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/the-aviator/" target="_blank">an endless runner game</a> and
            <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/games/cyberorb/" target="_blank">a 2D maze game</a>. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I also had a lot of fun with shaders and made some GLSL experiments, 
            for <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/shaders-2d/?index=33&fill=1" target="_blank">2D planes</a> 
            and <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/shaders-3d/?index=3" target="_blank">3D objects</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            My last expirement was taking an existing shader to create a <a href="https://dev.arnedecant.be/webgl/mandelbulb/" target="_blank">mandelbulb</a> 
            and made it configurable, using three.js. It's important to know this will not work on all devices, as it requires a lot of GPU power.
